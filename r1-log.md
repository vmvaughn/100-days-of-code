# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - VM Vaughn

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 2, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the FCC Tribute page. Built this project before using Bootstrap for styling and layout. Rebuilding Tribute page so that I use vanilla CSS for styling and layout. Setup GitHub repo for project at https://github.com/vmvaughn/fcc-tribute-page.git

### R1D2 
Ran tests against the example tribute project in FCC to get the rubric I need to meet for my project to pass. Passed 8 of the 10 tests that were my objective for today. These tests demonstrate that I should focus on the html first, including adding the id and class attributes for subsequent styling with CSS. If I try to style the html as I go, I'll get bogged down too quick. Get the starting html done and then style/position the elements. (Also, here's the link to my 100-days-of-code repository on GitHub. I'm using the r1-log.md to record my progress and thoughts. https://github.com/vmvaughn/100-days-of-code.git)

### R1D3
First worked on styling to center image and make it responsive to pass remaining 2 tests. Reset default margins/padding and added background colors to match FCC example. A bit more to finish styling so that this project is done. I'm not going to "over-cook" it. Make it pass tests, make it look good enough...and move on. 

### R1D4
Added margins and paddings, changed to open-sans font from Google, adjusted font-weight for headings. Once I finish styling for "wrap-up" section and footer at page bottom I'll be ready to pass all tests and move on to next project.

### R1D5
Completed FCC Tribute Page project. Passed all tests. https://codepen.io/vmvaughn/full/dwdYOz

### R1D6
Started FCC Survey Form project. Read tests. Observed behaviour of FCC example at different viewport sizes. I think I'll use flexbox to make my page respond like the example. Not going to be creative, just recreate the example and pass tests. Objective is to apply what I've learned to build a form and make it responsive with flexbox. 

### R1D7
html added for form, input fields for name, email, age, and submit button. Passed all tests for html added so far. Total tests passed for this work session: 13 of 17.

### R1D8
html added for dropdown lists. Passed test for that. Total tests passed for this project so far: 14 of 17.

### R1D9
html added for radio button set, checkbox set, and textarea for FCC Survey form. Passed 17 of 17 tests. Now time to style page...

### R1D10
Reinforced my learning of CSS Flexbox by reading this excellent Medium article https://medium.com/@js_tut/flexbox-the-animated-tutorial-8075cbe4c1b2?sk=fa94a4ec74ddef706e41d3011eecc184 and the awesome CSS Visual Dictionary 2nd Edition, both by https://twitter.com/js_tut 

## R1D11
Reinforced my learning of CSS Grid by redoing @freeCodeCamp challenges and reading CSS Visual Dictionary 2nd Edition by https://twitter.com/js_tut

## R1D12
Got CSS Grid working for basic layout. A bit more styling needed before I'm done with the FCC Survey form. 

## R1D13
Styled columns more. Bit more to go to wrap-up FCC Survey form.

## R1D14

##R1D15: Added media query at max-device-width to make responsive. Added margins for header, description, and submit button. Next up...add margins and background colors for body and main to wrap up FCC Survey form. 

##R1D16: Added margins and background colors to responsive design. Project complete and submitted for FCC cert.
