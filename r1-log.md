# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - VM Vaughn

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Jan 2, Wednesday, 2019].

## Log

### R1D1 
Started the FCC Tribute page. Built this project before using Bootstrap for styling and layout. Rebuilding Tribute page so that I use vanilla CSS for styling and layout. Setup GitHub repo for project at https://github.com/vmvaughn/fcc-tribute-page.git

### R1D2 
Ran tests against the example tribute project in FCC to get the rubric I need to meet for my project to pass. Passed 8 of the 10 tests that were my objective for today. These tests demonstrate that I should focus on the html first, including adding the id and class attributes for subsequent styling with CSS. If I try to style the html as I go, I'll get bogged down too quick. Get the starting html done and then style/position the elements. (Also, here's the link to my 100-days-of-code repository on GitHub. I'm using the r1-log.md to record my progress and thoughts. https://github.com/vmvaughn/100-days-of-code.git)
